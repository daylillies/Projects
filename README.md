# Projects

This repository contains a collection of data science and machine learning apps developed using both R and Python. The projects span a variety of domains, including finance, bioinformatics, sports analytics, and predictive modelling. Below is a summary of the key applications:

## R Shiny Apps

1. **BMI Calculator**  
   A web app built with R Shiny that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user inputs (height and weight). The app provides a visual scale indicating where the user's BMI falls on the spectrum from underweight to obese, along with a numeric display of their BMI.

2. **Iris Predictor**  
   A classification app that uses the Iris dataset to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its physical measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). Built using a Random Forest model, the app makes predictions and displays the results interactively.

3. **Basic Weather App**  
   A simple R Shiny app that predicts whether a game of golf can be played based on weather data. The app uses a Random Forest classification model trained on weather-related features.

4. **Ozone Histogram App**  
   An app that visualises the distribution of ozone levels through histograms. The data is used to explore the relationship between various weather features and ozone concentrations.

## Python Data Science Apps

1. **Basic Crypto App**  
   A Python app that downloads cryptocurrency data from Yahoo Finance and processes it into CSV files for further analysis. It does not provide real-time data but focuses on historical trends.

2. **Yahoo Finance Crypto CSV Updated**  
   A Python tool that downloads cryptocurrency data from Yahoo Finance and processes it into CSV files for further analysis.

3. **Basic Stock App**  
   A simple stock prediction app that uses historical stock market data to provide insights into trends and potential future movements. Built with machine learning models, it provides stock data analysis.

4. **Basketball Analysis**  
   A Python app that analyses basketball player statistics and provides insights into player performance using data science techniques.

5. **Bioinformatics Regression**  
   A regression-based Python app that uses bioinformatics data to predict various outcomes. It applies machine learning to bioinformatics datasets to find correlations and make predictions.

6. **DNA Counter App**  
   A Python tool designed to analyse DNA sequences, counting occurrences of specific genes or patterns within the sequence. Useful for bioinformatics applications.

7. **Penguin Classification**  
   A machine learning app that classifies penguin species based on various features such as size, shape, and geographic location. It uses the popular `penguins` dataset and demonstrates classification techniques.

8. **S&P 500 Analysis**  
   A Python app that performs an analysis of the S&P 500 index. It includes stock price analysis, trend forecasting, and visualisations of historical performance.

9. **Simple Iris Prediction**  
   A straightforward Python app that uses the Iris dataset for classification tasks. It predicts flower species based on physical attributes and visualises the decision boundaries created by the model.
